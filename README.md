## Logbook Project

I started this logbook project as an attempt to keep focused on my own thesis.
I believe keeping in mind brief inspirational moments is important in research processes, and I also wanted to track some other aspects of my _soon-professional_ journey; like my emotional and menthal states. I know we were told as science students that these things are not _that important_, but after struggling with ups and downs, maniac states and the desertic hell of _deep depression_ I really really hope this \LaTeX logbook works as a personal journal for you, too.

PS. You're smart, you're kind and you're loved. Please excuse my terrible english.
